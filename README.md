# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that can be solved using any programming language you like.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is placed in a separate directory named `day_x` where `x` is the day number.

## Using Jest for Problem Solving

To solve these problems, I use Jest, which enables me to test various scenarios effectively, aiding in deciphering the puzzles.

### Setting Up Jest

Before running the tests, ensure that Jest is installed. Jest can be installed using npm with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

And then use `npm run test $PATH_TO_TEST`.
